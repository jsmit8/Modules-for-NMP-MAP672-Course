<h2> Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto
Well, the Floating Sheep Manifesto was quite an awesome read!  I firmly, or at least currently, place myself among the cartographers.  The reason I say that is I loved making maps in 671, but some of the theory behind making a good map seemed 'fussy' to me.  However, I'm not saying that's because I'm lazy or don't care.  That's not the reason at all.  The reason is simple: I love maps.  I love looking at all kinds of maps, be they old, new or cartoonish.  I've always loved them and always will.  However, I'm completely new at this whole mapmaking game.  I'm a trained animal scientist and veterinary epidemiologist.  I trained at Berea College, University of Wisconsin, University of Kentucky and John's Hopkins.  And all my training and three degrees prepared me for being a scientist, not someone skilled in geographic theory. So, I am woefully unskilled in geography or GIS or theory in the field.  I decided to do the graduate certificate through New Maps Plus to correct some of that, and to learn how to make good maps for sheer enjoyment of learning about something I enjoy, yet know so little about.  The benefit that it will ultimately help me in my job as an epidemiologist tracking animal diseases is a bonus!

My priorities for moving forward in mapping are simple.  I want to be able to make maps for fun, just because I enjoy them.  I also, however, want to be able to make useful maps for work: maps that are simple, beautiful, and filled with useful information for veterinarians.  The maps I want to make may not be useful to many people, but if they are useful for my clients, i.e. veterinarians and their staff, that can be useful in showing patterns of disease movement or antibiotic resistance, then I'll be a very happy camper.

The main points I find provocative, yet also problematic, is number 2, All Maps Lie, but lies are the source of a map's power.  
    It is essential to lie with maps. The process of making a map inherently depends on upon this due to the natural distortion of conveying a three-dimensional planet on a two-dimensional plane. The real world is full of information such as landmarks, water, arbitrary borders, etc. It’s impossible to put all of that data on a single map, therefore it is up to the mapmaker to decide what information is important (due to what information is trying to be presented) and thus suppressing other features. The caveat to remember is that the data the mapmaker is using can be used to create an indefinite number of the same types of maps or different maps. 

    Considering that all maps usually convey scale, projection, and symbolization; these features are multiple sources of distortion. Scale (graphic, verbal or ratio) relates to a set distance on your map that represents a real distance on the physical ground. This has to fundamentally represent the same units; otherwise, the map will make no sense. Projections, which transform the curved 3-D nature of the planet into the mapmaker’s 2-D representation, will easily also distort reality. World maps often use a cylindrical projection, while individual areas usually use a local projection. The scale ratio to convert distances in these cases easily yield an incorrect result. We tolerate this erroneous information because a projection is a compromise; no flat map can correctly preserve all the areas, angles, distances or directions of the earth. Graphic symbols make places and other features visible on the map. However, deciding what to select as map features allows the suppression of information deemed unimportant.

Basically, you have to lie with a map.  The mapmaker is deciding what's important, by putting it on the map.  What the mapmaker leaves off the map is just as important! We know this because maps have been used for propaganda in the past, and still are. Even the CIA has a cartography division. </h2>
