NPM MAP672 Course Summer 2016

I'm excited to learn JS programming!

## MY LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    1. To understand your guys crazy programming language, its like heiroglyphics to veterinary epidemiologists!
    2. To not go bald and become an alcholic while learning JS and HTML
    3. To quit asking myself "why did I do this?  I like maps, but this programming is nuts!" everytime I look at my computer
    4. To be able to get to the end and be able to understand this weird language your refer to as "programming"
    5. To become the ultimate nerd and not only like this programming, but become adept at it
    6. To have a beer and talk maps with Rich at some point
    P.S.  Hope that Rich understands I have a warped sense of humor; just ask Boyd.  I have to, I work with dead animals, but seriously will by  
    Rich a beer if he wants to talk maps sometime. It's becoming more and more important in the epidemiolgy world of veterinary medicine.
